  "fullDescription": "La Feria de Tristán Narvaja is the famous Montevideo street market. Sometimes it’s called “flea market”, but I would refrain from this description simply because it is so much more than just a place to sell secondhand goods. When the day is just about to start, the area transforms into a strange universe. Greengrocers screaming at the top of their lungs vying for potential customers attention. ",
